<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am a frontend-focused developer with hands-on experience in building responsive and interactive web and mobile applications. I work primarily with JavaScript, React, and React Native, and have experience integrating frontend interfaces with backend APIs using FastAPI. I have previously interned as a Java Developer at FedEx, where I gained exposure to enterprise workflows and system architecture, and as a Full Stack & AI Intern at Condor AI, where I worked across frontend development and machine learning features. My academic and project work includes UI/UX design, data visualization, machine learning model evaluation, and system-level applications such as distributed systems and Edge AI solutions. I am comfortable with Git-based version control, collaborative development, and translating complex requirements into clean, user-friendly interfaces.</p>
